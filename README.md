# Push2_MIDI_Scripts

MIDI Scripts included with Ableton Live are compiled and editing them is unsupported. Scripts are sometimes changed without notice, which can cause your edits to make the application unstable. Decompiling the scripts is simple and almost always works without issue. It is also unsupported and probably breaks license. However, placing .py files into Ableton directories will compile them on application start (no telling if this will be removed, but I doubt it). This allows to make simple or very complex edits to the functionality of your controllers.

Push 2 is almost entirely controlled via sysex and python scripts, so it is possible to make it do some things a bit better or make your live performances safer. For the most part, you can use Max4Live to adjust the functionality, but it was quicker to edit the MIDI scripts in my use case.
